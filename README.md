# Dev Session Boilerplate

## Hello there fellow dev!

For the day of our meeting we'll be having a 90 minute pair programming session where we'll be building a very simple app. You'll be presented with the full details during our meeting and we'll be walking through it together.

For now all you need to do is clone this repo and get familiar with it - it's a very very basic codebase, for sure you won't need to invest too much time ;)

See you then!
