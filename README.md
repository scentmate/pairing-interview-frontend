# Dev Session Boilerplate

## Hello there fellow dev!

For the day of our meeting we'll be having a 90 minute pair programming session where we'll be building a very simple app. You'll be presented with the full details during our meeting and we'll be walking through it together.

For now all you need to do is clone this repo, create a branch and name it with your first and last name separated by a hyphen.

See you then!
